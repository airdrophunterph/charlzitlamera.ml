## Q&A Preparation

**Common Questions & Suggested Responses:**

**Q: How do you ensure data security for sensitive student information?**
A: Security is designed into every layer of our architecture. We will implement AES-256 encryption for all stored data and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. Our JWT implementation will use the RS256 algorithm with rotating keys and appropriate expiration periods. All PII will be stored in isolated database partitions with restricted access controls. We're planning quarterly security assessments and will pursue SOC 2 compliance as we scale. The platform is being built with FERPA compliance in mind, ensuring it will meet all educational data protection requirements for institutions of higher learning.

**Q: What makes Svvy different from existing application platforms like Common App or ApplyWeb?**
A: Unlike Common App, which focuses primarily on undergraduate admissions with a desktop-first approach, Svvy supports all program types with a mobile-first design. Based on industry research, mobile-optimized application platforms can increase completion rates by up to 70% compared to desktop-only solutions. Compared to ApplyWeb/Slate, our document standardization system is projected to reduce administrative processing time significantly and eliminate cross-platform compatibility issues. Our anti-caching solution delivers real-time status updates immediately after changes occur, versus the industry standard of several hours for status propagation. We anticipate this will substantially reduce support tickets related to application status confusion as we roll out to more institutions.

**Q: How do you handle integration with existing school systems like Banner, Workday Student, or PeopleSoft?**
A: We've designed our integration architecture to be compatible with all major SIS platforms including Banner (Ellucian), Workday Student, PeopleSoft Campus Solutions, and Jenzabar. For Banner integration, we'll utilize a custom API bridge that synchronizes application data, documents, and status updates bidirectionally. With Workday, we'll leverage their documented APIs with middleware that handles field mapping and data transformation. All integration projects will follow our planned 5-phase implementation methodology, with a dedicated solutions architect assigned to each institution to ensure a smooth transition and proper data flow between systems.

**Q: What's your pricing model for institutions?**
A: Our pricing will be structured to scale with institutional needs. For a mid-sized institution (5,000-15,000 students), we're planning a standard package around $25,000 annually, which would include a set number of applications and all core features. Additional applications would be priced individually. Enterprise pricing for larger institutions would include more applications and potential volume discounts. Implementation fees will depend on the complexity of integrations required. We plan to offer multi-year agreements with guaranteed pricing and discounts for longer commitments. All plans will include unlimited users, SLA guarantees, and comprehensive support packages. We're currently finalizing our pricing structure and would be happy to discuss custom pricing based on your specific requirements.
